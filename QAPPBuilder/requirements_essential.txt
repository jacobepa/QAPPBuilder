# Check Python versions = "version Python 3.9.0 (64-bit)."
# This requirements document was generated in the following way:
# 1. Create a new python virtual environment.
# 2. Install packages in this environment from the previous requirements file in Github
# 3. Delete the existing requirements file.
# 4. Generate this requirements file.
# This method ensures that all installed packages are in the requirements file, which
# includes packages that are sub-requirements of other packages.
