            <h3>Center for Environmental Solutions & Emergency Response (CESER)</h3>

            <p> A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) is a document describing in
                comprehensive detail the necessary quality assurance, quality control,
                and other technical activities that must be implemented to ensure the
                results of the work performed will satisfy the stated performance criteria.
                This web application was developed to assist CESER staff with development
                of approved QAPPs using a team approach. QAPPs created using this web app
                for active research projects are available to facilitate their use during
                ongoing research and to provide examples during planning of new research,
                as well as export the final product for QA Review and approval and entry
                into the <b>ORD QA TRACK</b> database.</p>

            <p> More comprehensive guidance on developing QAPPs for research projects is provided
                in the EPA-240-R-02-009 report titled "<b><i>Guidance for Quality Assurance Project
                Plans EPA QA G-5.</b></i>" The completed checklist will be entered into QA
                Track with the approved QAPP by the QA Manager when final. The work on
                this project has been approved under the CESER QAPP K-LRTD-0032360-QP-1-0.</p>
